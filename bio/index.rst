My name is Nicolas Fauchereau, I am a climate scientist at `NIWA <http://www.niwa.co.nz>`_ (The National Institute for Water and Atmospheric research) in New Zealand, 
in the Climate and Environmental Applications group, and based in Hamilton. My primary research interests are about scale interactions in the climate system 
(e.g. between intra-seasonal and interannual variability, and synoptic-scale and near-global scales) and climate predictability from sub-seasonal to seasonal scales.   

I am also exploring the use of Machine Learning approaches for scientific discovery and for improving climate forecasting.   

I am a big fan of the `Python programming language <https://www.python.org/>`_ and the `Python Scientific Ecosystem <https://scipy.org/>`_. 

My favorite Python packages are: 

- `Pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org>`_ 
- `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_
- `xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org>`_ 
- `cartopy <https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/>`_ 
- `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/>`_
